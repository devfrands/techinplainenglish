# Tech in Plain & Profane English
A project to explain tech in plain, profane English

## Introduction
Every single tech thing that is intimidating sounding and scary is actually incredibly simple and stupid once you actually get past the bad documentation, gatekeeping language, and smug techbros.

## Analogies
* Docker: “pretend my computer lives somewhere else”
* AWS: “put shit on someone else’s computer, but it’s in las vegas. also make it really hard to mess with stuff on that computer with a lot of rules about who can log in to it”
* Lambda Functions: “grab a computer from las vegas and run this 4 line python script on it, then shut down”
* Jenkins/Continuous Integration/Deployment: “take all the shit i normally do manually by logging into a computer somewhere else and doing a bunch of terminal commands and just do it for me”
* Microservices: “only three people are ever going to want a copy of your self-published romance novel. it costs $50,000 to keep a computer in las vegas on 24/7 for a year. just pay for the 2 minutes it takes to send three people your romance novel and then throw the computer into a volcano”
